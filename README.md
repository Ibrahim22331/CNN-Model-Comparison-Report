# CNN Model Comparison on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This repository compares the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with other machine learning models like Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project demonstrates how CNNs outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is split into:
- 50,000 training images
- 10,000 test images

The 10 classes are:
- Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need Python and the following libraries:
- TensorFlow (for CNN)
- Scikit-learn (for Logistic Regression and k-NN)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
